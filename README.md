# Coding Challenge #1 (`wc`)

## Overview

This repo is my solution to John Crickett's [Coding Challenge #1 - Build your own wc!](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-1).

## Steps

- [x] 0: Project setup and fetching test file (e.g. `$ curl -0 https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/132/pg132.txt test.txt`)
- [x] 1: Implement `ccwc` and the `-c` flag (i.e. bytes) for the `test.txt` file
- [x] 2: Implement `-l` (i.e. lines) for the `test.txt` file
- [x] 3: Implement `-w` (i.e. words) for the `test.txt` file
- [x] 4: Implement `-m` (i.e. characters) for the `test.txt` file
- [x] 5: Support default option (i.e. `-clm` in the absence of any flags)
- [ ] 6: Implement support for standard input if no filename is specified
